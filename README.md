# Grasp-and-Lift-EEG-detection
This is project for fulfilment of the course Brain Computer Interfaces and Application <br />
National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, R.O.C, Spring Semester 2021. <br /> <br />

### Project objective:
1. To find the significant features that can improve the model performance
2. To implement the classification model to accurately classify the different hand movements by using EEG signals. 

### Dataset:
We use, "Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection (GAL) dataset" (Luciw, Jarocka & Edin, 2014). <br />
The dataset is available on Kaggle and was used as a competition in 2015 <br />
The brief information about the dataset is shown below; <br />
  - 3,960 trials in total
  - 32 channals EEG record
  - 12 participants
  - 10 series of trial subjects and ~ 30 trials on each series.
      - Object used and action:
          - different weight (165, 330, 660 g)
          - different surface (sandpaper, suede, silk surface)
          - different action e.g. enforcing change in fingertip, grasp with thumb and index finger and  lift and hold
